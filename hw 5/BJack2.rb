# # Build blackjack For level 1 include at least 2 players(you and the computer.) 
# You should include the hit(deal another card) or stand(don't deal another card) 
# The dealer(the computer) should make it's own decision as to when it should hit and when it should stand. 
# So you shouldn't be inputting hit or stand for it. 
# Your app should declare a winner as soon as someone reaches 21, someone exceeds 21(they lose), or if both you and the computer stand.

# Take Blackjack further!
# â€‹The program should ask how many people are playing and deal to everyone.
# Each player should be able to bet money.
# The program should be able to tell the player how much money they've won or lost.
# The program should ensure no cards are repeated on the table at one time. So the computer and I shouldn't have the King of Spades at the same time.
